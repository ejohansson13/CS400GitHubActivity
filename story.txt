Trending towards the end of September, the weather was still comfortable in the mid-70's, but students were unable to enjoy being outside.
The workload was relentless and though they knew it would all be worth it one day, at the moment they wanted nothing more than to be a Communications major able to 
take the day off and complete their schoolwork in one night. 

Surely, this career choice was worth it. Everyone claimed it was so much easier to aquire a job as a programmer then as a buissness major, but it didn't matter how 
many people kept saying it, right now, it felt like the hardest thing to be. It was as if the Atlus himself decided to abandon his post, and to keep everything up, 
they had to strain themselves even more as the pandemic stripped them of every social interaction they had. Gone were they days of lecture participation, being exchanged 
for more labor or more quizes to show you watched a video. Gone were the days of working in a lounge or library, replaced with the confines of ones own walls. 
The same four walls.

Soon, madness set in. It wasn't the monotony of daily life, nor was it the never-ending deluge of work. No, it was those four walls. Everywhere he looked, there they were. Nothing he did would make them go away. 
All he has wanted was a day off, but instead he was watched. He tried placing posters, but the white peeked through. 
He tried keeping the lights off to not see the walls, but they were there, watching. Soon he got the most fabulous idea, to paint the walls. He painted them red, in honor of his school. But sadly, that didn't change anything. It wasn't the color of the walls, it was the walls themselves. All he wished was to see another human...but he never did.
