Trending towards the end of September, the weather was still comfortable in the mid-70's, but students were unable to enjoy being outside.
The workload was relentless and though they knew it would all be worth it one day, at the moment they wanted nothing more than to be a Communications major able to 
take the day off and complete their schoolwork in one night. 

Surely, this career choice was worth it. Everyone claimed it was so much easier to aquire a job as a programmer then as a buissness major, but it didn't matter how 
many people kept saying it, right now, it felt like the hardest thing to be. It was as if the Atlus himself decided to abandon his post, and to keep everything up, 
they had to strain themselves even more as the pandemic stripped them of every social interaction they had. Gone were they days of lecture participation, being exchanged 
for more labor or more quizes to show you watched a video. Gone were the days of working in a lounge or library, replaced with the confines of ones own walls. The same four walls.
